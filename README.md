This is the repo for creating a working Google Earth placemark for French V.

### Editing your placemark
1. Click the "Clone or download" button in the top right corner.
2. Open the ZIP, and open `index.html` with TextWrangler.
3. Go to line 79, and change the title inside the `<h1></h1>` to the title of your monument.
4. Go to line 81-83, and insert your placemark paragraph text inside the `<p></p>`.
5. If you have a webpage link, go to line 86 and put the complete url (with http://) in the `href=""`.
6. Put the default image you want to display in the first `img` on line 89, inside the `src=""`.
7. If you don't want your image to change on hovering, put the same url in the `img` on line 90. Otherwise, put the image you want to display on hover inside the `src=""` on line 90.
8. Copy everything in the document and paste into your placemark.
9. Test your placemark.
10. Have a party, because that was easy.

### Tips
- Keep in mind that the text needs to be brief. Linking to a webpage is awesome, and we may work on it later, but for now try to limit your placemark to ~3 sentences.
- Please refer to this page for the instructions, as it is always the latest version. It has the latest instruction and latest version of the template.
